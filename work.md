## Research Project with Dr. Samay Pande
**Research Project on evolution of antibiotic resistance**
*August 2022 - June 2023*
<ul class='container' style='display list-item;'>
<li> Understanding the influence of multiple selection-constrains on the de-novo evolution of antibiotic resistance</li>
<li> Studying evolution of antibiotic resistance in prey bacteria in the presence of a predator and evolution of escape strategies by the prey. The model system used was of M xanthus (predator) and E coli, P fluorescence and S enterica (prey).</li>
<li> Experimental coevolution of M xanthus and three prey bacteria - Microbial culture techniques</li>
<li> Analysis of predatory efficiency of and competition between clones of M xanthus from a population mixing evolution experiment</li>
<li> Standardisation of NGS based Frequency Analysis of M xanthus and E coli clones</li>
</ul>
