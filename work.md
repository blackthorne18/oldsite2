## PhD with Dr. James Hall
### Plasmid-Host Dynamics in the context of Antibiotic Resistance 
<div class='timeslot'>October 2023 - ongoing </div>
- Studying persistence of antimicrobial resistance as a function of plasmid persistence in the host
- Understanding the interaction dynamics of the plasmid and the host genome

## Research Project with Dr. Samay Pande
### Research Project on evolution of antibiotic resistance 
<div class='timeslot'>August 2022 - June 2023 </div>
- Understanding the influence of multiple selection-constrains on the de-novo evolution of antibiotic resistance
- Studying evolution of antibiotic resistance in prey bacteria in the presence of a predator and evolution of escape strategies by the prey. The model system used was of M xanthus (predator) and E coli, P fluorescence and S enterica (prey).
- Experimental coevolution of M xanthus and three prey bacteria - Microbial culture techniques
- Analysis of predatory efficiency of and competition between clones of M xanthus from a population mixing evolution experiment
- Standardisation of NGS based Frequency Analysis of M xanthus and E coli clones

## Masters Thesis with Dr. Frederic Bertels
### Studying the dynamics of REPIN movement in bacterial genomes
<div class='timeslot'>March 2021 - June 2022 </div>
- Understanding movement patterns and duplication rate of REPIN Transposable Elements in Pseudomonas genome sequences
- Creating and testing of REPIN Clusterer - a Bioinformatics pipelines in Python Programming Language 
- Developed innovative computational method of clustering REPIN Sequences together based on orthology 
- Established events of duplication of REPIN Sequences based on the Clusters and calculated their rate of duplication. 
- Critical analysis of potential theories on movement of REPIN within host genome 
- Automated BLAST searches, isolated genes, compared genes, built, compared and analysed phylogenetic trees, curated computer code and datasets

## iGEM 2020 Project 
### Beta-cells in Gut Producing Insulin (BIG-PIE)
<div class='timeslot'>February 2020 - October 2020 </div>
- A new method of providing insulin to patients with diabetes
- Helped Brainstorm project ideas during the nascent stage
- Helped with building the Project Website
- Contributed to Outreach and Science Communication by conducting seminars for School students
- Gold Medal Winning Project at The Giant Jamboree, iGEM 2020

## iGEM 2019 Project 
### Ecoli Learns Suboptimal Acclimatisation (ELSA)
<div class='timeslot'>February 2019 - October 2019 </div>
- Synthetically modifying Ecoli to grow optimally at 4 degrees Celsius
- Helped manage the Wet Lab experiments by performing Growth Curve experiments to analyse the effect of our Gene of Interest
- Helped the Outreach and Integrated Human Practices team by talking to people in the industry regarding our product.
- Silver Medal Winning Project at The Giant Jamboree, iGEM 2019
