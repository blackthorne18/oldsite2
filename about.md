# My Backstory

Brought up in cheerful and welcoming South Bengaluru, I grew up loving to play cricket, exploring the imaginative islands that spanned my home and reading books untill I ran out of them.
I spent all of my 13 years of Education at my second home, the Kumaran Group of Institutions. For the most part, Kumarans really shaped much of what I am today. Joining IISER to study Science, really, in many ways, began the next chapter of my life.

I always have an active hobby, although it's constantly changing. From months of learning Chess to practicing coding for wanting to work for Google, from folding origami for days on end to wanting to live like Bear Grylls, I find great joy in sampling the buffet of life.

When I'm not writing code to understand evolution of selfish genetic elements or growing bacterial cultures to study the effect of our GOI, I like to test my courage and face Kubolds and Krakken while playing Dungeons and Dragons or I try to go for walks outdoor listening to podcasts. I definitely reccomend listening to 'This Week in Evolution'(TWiEVO) a podcast hosted by Dr. Nels Elde and Prof. Vincent Racaniello.
